[![Watch Video](https://github.com/murtazahassan/Object-Following-Robot/blob/master/ObjectFollowingRobotThumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/SWaYRyi0TTs)

Train and classify Traffic Signs using Convolutional neural networks This will be done using  OPENCV in real time using a simple webcam .CNNs have been gaining popularity in the past couple of years due to their ability to generalize and classify the data with high accuracies. In this video we will train traffic signs with over 35000 images of 43 different classes with the help of tensorflow and keras . By the end of the video  I be will sharing information that will help you classify your own data set. Info such as  how long does it take to train and how much data of each class is required to have a good classification model.
